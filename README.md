<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Tatiana</a> 
<img src="https://github.com/Meniaylo/Meniaylo/blob/main/images/hello.gif" height="60"/></h1>

### What I'm about here is:
- enhancing my educational projects and seeking new ones,
- working with my code's conciseness and beauty (that will save the world, I'm sure),
- going to master TypeScrypt and Vue (as soon as my brain is ready for it),
- aspire to find stylish, beautiful product to care for and learn with,
- want to collaborate with skilled, talented colleagues,
- building a better life, of course - and, first and foremost, it is about inspiration and passion, not money.
